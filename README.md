# KD-Trees
KD-Trees is a project that I have worked on at University Of Massachusetts Boston.  In this project I learned about Symbol Tables and how
we can use symbol tables to help us find neighbors closest to us and neighbors farthest away from us. With this knowledge one can
determine groups of data. Examples are such as birds flying in clusters. There is a visual representation of kd-trees.
